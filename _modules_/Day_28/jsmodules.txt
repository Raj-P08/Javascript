JS Modules****

-> Modules are used to transfer the data from one js file to another js file.
-> i.e. we can import and export the data.
-> there are 2 types of Modules
1. common js
2. ES6 Modules

1) commonjs Modules:-
-> It work only on the server side
-> In order to export the data we can use module.exports property which takes one object as a value where we can pass the data which we want to export.
-> To import the data we can use require() method which takes one argument i.e. file path and this method returns all the data in the form of object.

2) ES6 Modules:-
-> It works only on the browser side.
-> There are 2 types in ES6 module.
i. Default export
ii. Named export

-> Here we should use the extension .mjs and also we should pass one attribute type='module' in the script tag.
-> In Default export only one data we can able to transfer.
**Syntax: export default data;  (export statement)
import identifier from (file path);  (import statement)


-> IN Named export we can transfer multiple data and to export the data we should use export keyword and it should prefixed before the data.
-> import statement for Named export-
    import {identifiers} from 'file path';

-> we can also change the identifier name using 'as' keyword.
